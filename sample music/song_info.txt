These are a few royalty free songs i was looking at for bg music.
I thought mellowtron might be good for he opening menus and the other 2 as choices for gameplay music.
The second one also has a few other songs that sound similar but have different tempos, may be 
useful if we want to play something faster as a player gets closer to the level end time.
